To install this package, you can try by using pip\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ bash}
\DoxyCodeLine{pip\ install\ z2r\_accel}

\end{DoxyCode}
 If there is no available distribution available for your machine, you\textquotesingle{}ll need to install it from git. You can try this by pasting\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{pip\ install\ numpy\ pybind11\ pybind11-\/stubgen\ scikit-\/build-\/core}
\DoxyCodeLine{pip\ install\ git+https://github.com/algolab-\/quantique/Stage-\/A25-\/Zakary.git\ }

\end{DoxyCode}
 If this still doesn\textquotesingle{}t work, you\textquotesingle{}ll need to build it directly from source.

On most Linux distributions, GCC/clang are pre-\/installed and with Open\+MP support. No need to do anything extra. \end{quote}
